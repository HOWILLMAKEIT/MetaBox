# Quickstart

🚀 Hi！Here is **the fastest way to begin your journey of MetaBox**. 🚀

## Installation

```bash
conda create -n metaevobox_env python=3.11.5 -y
conda activate metaevobox_env
pip install metaevobox
```

## MetaBBO's Core Concept

> 💡 **MetaBox is an all-in-one platform for using and developing the algorithms in Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO)**. 💡

MetaBBO, an emerging research direction in recent years, aims to automate the design of BBO algorithms by constructing intelligent agents as replacements for human experts.

```{image} /_static/metabbo.png
:alt: MetaBBO

```

Its dual-layer architecture synergizes:

- Low-level​​: Standard BBO algorithms for solving optimization problems.
- Meta-level​​: A parameterized AI agent that adjusts low-level algorithms in real-time based on their optimization status info.

Through meta-learning on target problem distribution, MetaBBO shifts from human-expertise-driven design to data-driven automation, delivering unprecedented generalization power and design efficiency, and the performance
exceeds that of traditional BBO.

For further exploration, we recommend reading the comprehensive survey : "[Toward Automated Algorithm Design: A Survey and Practical Guide to Meta-Black-Box-Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00625)" and exploring the curated repository [Awesome-MetaBBO](https://github.com/GMC-DRL/Awesome-MetaBBO), which aggregates MetaBBO-related research papers and code implementations.

## Common Usage

### 1. Train one MetaBox's algorithm on MetaBox's one dataset

🧪 General Training Code

```python
from metaevobox import Trainer, Config
from metaevobox.baseline.metabbo import XXX
from metaevobox.baseline.metabbo import XXX_Optimizer
from metaevobox.environment.problem.utils import construct_problem_set

user_config = {"train_problem": "xxx",
                   "train_difficulty": "xxx"
                   }
config = Config(user_config)

agent = XXX(config)
optimizer = XXX_Optimizer(config)
dataset = construct_problem_set(config)

trainer = Trainer(config, agent, optimizer, dataset)
trainer.train()
```

🎯 Example: Train GLEET on COCO's BBOB (10D, easy)

```python
from metaevobox import Trainer, Config
from metaevobox.baseline.metabbo import GLEET
from metaevobox.baseline.metabbo import GLEET_Optimizer
from metaevobox.environment.problem.utils import construct_problem_set

user_config = {"train_problem": "bbob-10D",
               "train_difficulty": "easy"
               }
config = Config(user_config)

agent = GLEET(config)
optimizer = GLEET_Optimizer(config)
dataset = construct_problem_set(config)

trainer = Trainer(user_config, agent, optimizer, dataset)
trainer.train()
```

🧪 General Tester Code

```python
from metaevobox import Tester, Config
from metaevobox.environment.problem.utils import construct_problem_set
user_config = {"test_problem": "xxx",
               "test_difficulty": "xxx"
               "baseline": ["xxx"]
               }
config = Config(user_config)
dataset = construct_problem_set(config)

tester = Tester(config, dataset)
tester.test()

                "baseline": ["GLEET"]
                }
config = Config(user_config)
dataset = construct_problem_set(config)

tester = Tester(config, dataset)
tester.test()
```
